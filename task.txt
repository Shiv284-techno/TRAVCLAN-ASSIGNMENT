Claude Code Prompt for Hotel Booking Data Analysis
Context
I'm working on a Business Analyst Intern assignment for TravClan involving hotel booking data analysis. I have a CSV file Hotel_bookings_final.csv with 30,000 rows and 24 columns containing booking transactions from an online travel platform.
Dataset Schema
The dataset contains these columns:

customer_id, property_id, city, star_rating
booking_date, check_in_date, check_out_date, travel_date
room_type, num_rooms_booked, stay_type
booking_channel, channel_of_booking, booking_status
booking_value, costprice, markup, selling_price
payment_method, refund_status, refund_amount
cashback, coupon_redeem, Coupon USed?

Assignment Requirements
1. Key Observations (Identify at least 3 meaningful trends)

Analyze booking patterns across channels, room types, and star ratings
Examine cancellation behavior patterns
Identify temporal trends and seasonal patterns

2. Root Cause Analysis

Investigate reasons for cancellation patterns
Analyze why certain booking channels/property types perform better
Examine seasonal/temporal trends affecting booking values and stay lengths

3. Business Recommendations

Strategies to reduce cancellations
Ways to improve profitability and increase repeat bookings
Opportunities for pricing, promotion, and channel optimization

Deliverables Needed

Python analysis code with comprehensive data exploration
Visualizations supporting key findings
Summary insights for business recommendations
